/*
Newton's law states : F=m*a, that is to say a=F/m
we integrate this equation with the following approximation : between each frame, the acceleration is constant (it's nearly true)
Notation : x(t) is the position during the current frame, x(t+dt) is the position we want to find for the next frame. Same for v(t)...
so we have v(t+dt)=(F/m)*dt + v(t) -> if we differentiate this equation, we indeed find back a=F/m
we integrate again the equation above considering that v is constant aswell
thus we get x(t+dt) = (1/2)*(F/m)*dt^2 + v(t)*dt + x(t) -> knowing F, m, dt, the speed of the particle and its position, we can guess its next position !
this is known as the leapfrog numerical integration. I think that it is equivalent to the Runge Kutta order 2 (RK2)
